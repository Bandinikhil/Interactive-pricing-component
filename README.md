## Page view and pricing totals

Here are the different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.

## Features

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers.

## Where to Find Everything

- Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.
- You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.
- The designs are in JPG static format. Use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`.
- Required assets are available in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
- Check the `style-guide.md` file for the color palette and fonts.

## Building Your Project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Here's a suggested process:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address.
3. Plan your project by reviewing the design and structuring the HTML.
4. Write the base styles for your project, including general content styles.
5. Start adding styles from the top of the page and work down, one section at a time.
